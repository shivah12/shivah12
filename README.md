### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Shreeti**](https://shreetimohapatraportfolio.vercel.app/), a full stack developer and product designer based in India.

I turn clean designs into fast, accessible frontends and enjoy building tools that feel effortless to use.

When I’m not deep in code or obsessing over design systems, I’m likely [**writing**](https://medium.com/@shreeti.mohapatra), watching movies, or exploring something offbeat in tech. I also love sharing what I learn and how I build—across dev logs, design posts, or just raw ideas through my linkedin and behance accounts.

Currently open to remote opportunities in full-stack/product engineering or UI/UX roles.
